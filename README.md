# Code Quiz

This web page generates a timed quiz to test the user's knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The interactive coding challenge is powered by JavaScript with dynamically updated HTML. The page is styled with Bootstrap as well as a minimal amount of CSS. The developer was asked to construct the following: 

* Timer function that starts when the first question is presented
* Tens seconds are subtracted from the clock if the user answers a questions incorrectly
* The quiz ends after five questions or if the timer hits zero
* When the game is over, ask users to save their initials and display it on a high scores page

# Installation
No installation is necessary. The code for this webpage can be found at [Github](https://github.com/mollymccollumwx/code-quiz). The [deployed website](https://mollymccollumwx.github.io/code-quiz/) features a simple code quiz with a clean, minimal design. 

# Usage
The user is greeted by a welcome message explaining the rules of the game.
